function t = t_B23(p)
% Calculate the temperature at the boundary between region  2 and region 3
%
%  Purpose: 
%    This function calculates the boundary between regions 2 and 3 that 
%  is defined as a backward equation of the B23-equation

% Define variables:
%   t             -- Temperature in K
%   p            -- Pressure in MPa
%   n            -- Numerical values of the coefficients of the B23-equation
%   s             -- Sign of the range, if the pressure is inputed
%                     between 16.5292MPa to 100MPa, s is set to be 1, 
%                     otherwise s is set to be 0 and the temperature at that
%                     point will be set to 0.
